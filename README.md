## This script with connect your rl_dna file (which is the rig logic node in metahuman file) to your skeleton so they can be controlled by the metahuman controllers, in maya. Remember your maya file already has one RL4 node in it, which is probably just unable to find the path of the dna file. This node will be created as index[1], the original will remain at index[0]

## For maya only!!
